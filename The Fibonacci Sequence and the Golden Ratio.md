# The Fibonacci Sequence and the Golden Ratio

## The Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It typically starts with 0 and 1, and follows the recursive pattern:

F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

This creates the sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on.

The sequence appears surprisingly often in nature, such as in the arrangement of leaves on stems, the spiral patterns of shells, and the branching of trees. It's named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci who introduced it to Western mathematics in his 1202 book "Liber Abaci."

## The Golden Ratio

The Golden Ratio (often represented by the Greek letter phi, Ï†) is approximately 1.61803399. It's a special mathematical constant where a line is divided in such a way that the ratio of the whole line to the larger segment equals the ratio of the larger segment to the smaller segment.

As demonstrated in the code, when I calculate the ratio between consecutive Fibonacci numbers (F(n)/F(n-1)), the result converges to the Golden Ratio as n increases. This convergence happens remarkably quickly, usually becoming accurate to several decimal places by n=20.

The Golden Ratio is considered aesthetically pleasing and has been used in art, architecture, and design throughout history. The Parthenon, Leonardo da Vinci's paintings, and even modern logos often incorporate proportions based on the Golden Ratio.

The Fibonacci spiral, which we visualize in our code, is closely related to the Golden Ratio. It's created by drawing quarter-circles connecting opposite corners of squares with sides of Fibonacci numbers, producing a pattern that approximates the "golden spiral."

This mathematical relationship between the Fibonacci sequence and the Golden Ratio demonstrates how seemingly simple patterns can reveal profound mathematical principles that connect number theory, geometry, and natural phenomena.
